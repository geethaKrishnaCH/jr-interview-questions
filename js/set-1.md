Tree Structure: The DOM represents the document as a hierarchical tree structure, where each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or piece of content in the document. The root node is the document itself.

Nodes: Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of the DOM. There are various types of nodes, such as elements, attributes, text, comments, etc.

Elements: Elements are the HTML or XML tags in the document, like `<div>`, <p>, <a>, etc. Each element is represented as a node in the tree and can have child nodes (other elements or text nodes).

Attributes: Elements can have attributes like class, id, src, etc. These attributes are accessible through the DOM and can be manipulated using scripting languages.

Content Manipulation: The DOM allows you to modify the content and structure of a web page in real time. You can add, remove, or modify elements and their content.

Event Handling: You can use the DOM to attach event listeners to elements. This enables interaction with users, like responding to clicks, form submissions, etc.

Cross-Language Compatibility: While the DOM is most commonly associated with JavaScript, it's not limited to it. Other programming languages can interact with the DOM using appropriate libraries or APIs.

Traversal and Manipulation: The DOM provides methods and properties that allow traversal (moving through the tree) and manipulation (editing nodes and their attributes) of the document.

Browser Independence: The DOM provides a standardized way to interact with documents across different browsers, making web development more consistent.

Dynamic Web Applications: Through the DOM, web developers can create interactive and dynamic web applications by manipulating the structure, content, and style of web documents based on user actions and other events.
